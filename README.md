# SJSU Operating System Project

[Link to Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oxKF2Op0ycr6g2Da_YqT2-a3mmvXrkOrC8Fc69U4vOY/edit?usp=sharing)

Operating System Project taken up under the sponsorship of San Jose State University's Society of Computer and Software Engineers. This will be the main repository of this project which will consist of the code for each of the components. 

## Project Guidelines
This project is not like other projects taken in a normal university. Creating an Operating System is a very difficult task and will require extensive research. However, there are a variety of classes that help with knowing how an OS functions.

### Classes Recommended
This list dictates what classes at SJSU (and potentially other schools) aid with knowledge on Operating Systems and other computer hardware related componets that an OS uses to function:

* Assembly Language Programming (CMPE 102)
* Computer Organization and Architecture (CMPE 120)
* Computer Architecture and Design (CMPE 140)
* Operating Systems Design (CMPE 142)
* Introduction to Computer Systems (CS 47)
* Computer Architecture (CS 147)
* Operating Systems (CS 149)

## Current Task
The current task being undertaken is to create a bootloader using UEFI. I have replicated the project from [theMike97](https://github.com/Swidjaja6/OpSysWork) in the Youtube tutorial series. It is entirely in x86 Assembly for Legacy BIOS and a good place to start before moving on to UEFI
